# playwith

*playwith* is an R package, providing a GTK+ graphical user interface
for editing and interacting with R plots.

I am not maintaining *playwith* any more. I have moved it to github,
as requested by some users, in the hope that it may be adopted.

The original project page is still up at
https://playwith.googlecode.com/ and it has a list of features and
screenshots that is not reproduced here.
