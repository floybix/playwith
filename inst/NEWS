
Changes in Version 0.8-54

  o argument `parameters`: automatically constructs
    widgets to control parameter values appearing in the call.

  o concept of the "main call" which accepts typical plot
    arguments (xlim, ylim, main, etc) -- not necessarily the
    top-level call. By default, a depth-first search is used
    to find a function that accepts `xlim` or `...`.

  o default action when dragging on the plot is zoom.
    default action on right-click is zoomout.

  o restrict zooming to x axis in time.mode
    ONLY IF a time.vector was not specified.

  o use RGtk2 rather than gWidgets for edit.call and edit.annotations
    because gWidgets is very slow.

  o enabled pretty ggplot2 plots (print.ggplot with pretty=TRUE)
    if using grid package version >= 2.7
    (older versions had a problem with viewports being popped).

  o code reorganisation: split tools into separate files; ESS style.
