
Changes in Version 0.8-54

  o default action when dragging on the plot is zoom.
    default action on right-click is zoomout.

  o playState$now.interacting defined as TRUE while tool
    interaction is active (playPointInput / playRectInput etc).

  o restrict zooming to x axis in time.mode
    ONLY IF a time.vector was not specified.

  o enabled pretty ggplot2 plots (print.ggplot with pretty=TRUE)
    if using grid package version >= 2.7
    (older versions had a problem with viewports being popped).

  o code reorganisation: split tools into separate files; ESS style.
