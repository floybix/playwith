  o arguments to `parameters` can use I() to force a spinbutton
    rather than slider.

  o plot call is initially evaluated in a try() block;
    hoping this will avoid "margins too small" error on linux.

Changes in Version 0.8-55

  o argument `parameters`: automatically constructs
    widgets to control parameter values appearing in the call.

  o default action when dragging on the plot is zoom.
    default action on right-click is zoomout.

  o restrict zooming to x axis in time.mode
    only if a time.vector was not specified.

  o whether to start in time.mode is determined by looking at
    the data: TRUE if the x data has a 'ts' or 'zoo' class.

  o concept of the "main function" which accepts typical plot
    arguments (xlim, ylim, main, etc) -- not necessarily the
    top-level call. By default, a depth-first search is used
    to find a function that accepts `xlim` or `...`.

  o use of relevant lattice plots without subscripts=TRUE
    will give a warning that identified points may be wrong.

  o callArg() now uses standard evaluation by default, rather than
    quoting its argument. Old code will need to be changed!

  o use RGtk2 rather than gWidgets for edit.call and edit.annotations
    because gWidgets is very slow.

  o reasonable guess for data points and labels with ggplot::qplot()

  o enabled pretty ggplot2 plots (print.ggplot with pretty=TRUE)
    if using grid package version >= 2.7
    (older versions had a problem with viewports being popped).

  o code reorganisation: split tools into separate files; ESS style.
